# Epistemic Science & Engineering: A Unified Framework

## Abstract

This document establishes the canonical structure of Epistemic Science & Engineering (ESE) as a unified field comprising ten distinct but interconnected disciplines. ESE represents the systematic study and design of intelligence systems across all scales and modalities. The field is organized around a fundamental distinction between **Epistemic Science** (6 fields studying natural laws, patterns, and principles of intelligence) and **Epistemic Engineering** (4 fields designing systems, mechanisms, and solutions for intelligence implementation).

This framework supersedes previous "layered stack" models by establishing ESE as a unified science with clear disciplinary boundaries, explicit Science→Engineering knowledge flows, Engineering→Science feedback loops, and comprehensive integration across all constituent fields. As intelligence systems grow more complex and autonomous, this unified framework becomes essential for ensuring that both scientific understanding and engineering practice advance in coordinated fashion toward the goal of beneficial, aligned, and effective intelligence systems.

## 1. Foundational Definition

### 1.1 Epistemic Science & Engineering

**Epistemic Science & Engineering** is the unified field dedicated to understanding and designing intelligence systems across all scales, from individual cognitive architectures to distributed ecosystems of knowledge. It encompasses both the scientific study of intelligence phenomena and the engineering practice of building effective intelligence systems.

The field addresses two fundamental questions:
- **Scientific Question**: What are the natural laws, patterns, and principles that govern intelligence systems?
- **Engineering Question**: How can we design and build intelligence systems that reliably exhibit desired properties and behaviors?

### 1.2 Science/Engineering Distinction

The fundamental organizing principle of ESE is the distinction between scientific inquiry and engineering practice:

**Epistemic Science** focuses on **understanding** - discovering natural laws, identifying patterns, and articulating principles that describe how intelligence systems naturally behave, evolve, and interact.

**Epistemic Engineering** focuses on **building** - designing systems, developing mechanisms, and creating solutions that reliably implement desired intelligence capabilities in real-world contexts.

This distinction mirrors other mature fields:
- Physics (science) → Mechanical Engineering (engineering)
- Chemistry (science) → Chemical Engineering (engineering)  
- Biology (science) → Biomedical Engineering (engineering)
- Computer Science (science) → Software Engineering (engineering)

## 2. Field Structure Overview
