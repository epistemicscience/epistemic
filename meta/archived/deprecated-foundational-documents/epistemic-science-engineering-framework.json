    "Abstract": "This document establishes the canonical structure of Epistemic Science & Engineering (ESE) as a unified field comprising ten distinct but interconnected disciplines. ESE represents the systematic study and design of intelligence systems across all scales and modalities. The field is organized around a fundamental distinction between **Epistemic Science** (6 fields studying natural laws, patterns, and principles of intelligence) and **Epistemic Engineering** (4 fields designing systems, mechanisms, and solutions for intelligence implementation).\n\nThis framework supersedes previous \"layered stack\" models by establishing ESE as a unified science with clear disciplinary boundaries, explicit Science→Engineering knowledge flows, Engineering→Science feedback loops, and comprehensive integration across all constituent fields. As intelligence systems grow more complex and autonomous, this unified framework becomes essential for ensuring that both scientific understanding and engineering practice advance in coordinated fashion toward the goal of beneficial, aligned, and effective intelligence systems.",
